### This particular analysis starts with some data clarification of some details used to explain certain "factors" shown in this data.
### Key details you need to know:
- Member: Annual Members which pay an extra $0.12/minute, capped at $3 for rides 45 minutes or less starting or ending outside Manhattan.
- Casual: Non-Members which pay $0.18/minute. Reduced Fare Bike Share Members pay $0.05/minute.
- Classic bike: regular pedal bikes with an adjustable seat, sturdy frame, 3-speed pedal shifter, responsive hand brakes, red lights-reflectors, front basket and durable tires.
- Docked bike: With speeds up to 18 MPH, these custom pedal-assist ebikes give you the power to tackle bridges, shave time off your commute, and experience more neighborhoods in less time. Just start pedaling and the power kicks in.
- The maps background color for the CitiBike stations locations is based on the 2018 Census Population by Zipcode data.
- The data gathered is only of the first 6 months of 2021, with the exception of January, in which the data was different with more personal details of each user.
- Since February 2021, the CitiBike company changed their data obtained from the users to be more private, for example taking out the gender and birthdate.

### Factors uncovered from the data:
1. Out of all the CitiBike users in Jersey City/Hoboken area, 58% are members with an annual membership. The rest are casual users per diem. Which can tell us that most of the users are locals that travel in bike because of traffic, pollution, saving money, parking and easy access to dense city areas.
2. 83% of the bikes rented are docked bikes (known as ebikes). One of the reasons that this factor is so significant, is because the docked bikes get a speed of up to 18 MPH without the user being pedaling.
3. The most used stations are close to the waterfront of Jersey City/Hoboken or near train stations. Which tells us again, that members and casuals are probably using the Citibikes to go to work downtown, go to the train to NYC, tour by the waterfront, etc.
4. Jersey City Citibike stations takes 77% of Total trips from the Jersey City/Hoboken area, even though the population in Jersey City is in the same range as Hoboken (18,000-213,000 people).
5. 9 out of the 10 Top Stations by number of trips are in Jersey City.
6. The average miles per trip does not exceed the 2 miles, giving us another point for the fact that the Citibikes are being used by members or casuals that live close or have short commutes in the city.
7. Members use the Citibikes mostly for the early commute in the morning rush hour between 5-6am with over 70% of Total miles in those hours.
8. Also, "peak hours" per month for CitiBike users are between 3-7PM in the evening rush hours.
9. In the winter (February), the amount of trips was on the low end not even reaching 500 total for Peak Hours. Some of the factors that affected this could possibly be: COVID-19, pandemic restrictions, snow storms, cold weather, less tourists, people move out, etc.
10. In the summer (June), reaches 7000+ bike trips in the Peak Hours which can be because the control of the COVID-19, less pandemic restrictions, opening of places, tourism, etc.
