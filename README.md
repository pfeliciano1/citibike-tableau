# Tableau: CitiBike Analysis 2021

### The charts in this presentation show the general information of CitiBike trips in the Jersey City/Hoboken area from February 2021 through June 2021, indicating the ride types, options for member and casual users, amount of trips per station, average miles per station and peak hours of usage.

### Some of the questions answered by this data analysis are:
1. What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?

2. What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?

3. Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)

4. What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?

### This particular analysis starts with some data clarification of some details used to explain certain "factors" shown in this data.
### Key details you need to know:
- Member: Annual Members which pay an extra $0.12/minute, capped at $3 for rides 45 minutes or less starting or ending outside Manhattan.
- Casual: Non-Members which pay $0.18/minute. Reduced Fare Bike Share Members pay $0.05/minute.
- Classic bike: regular pedal bikes with an adjustable seat, sturdy frame, 3-speed pedal shifter, responsive hand brakes, red lights-reflectors, front basket and durable tires.
- Docked bike: With speeds up to 18 MPH, these custom pedal-assist ebikes give you the power to tackle bridges, shave time off your commute, and experience more neighborhoods in less time. Just start pedaling and the power kicks in.
- The maps background color for the CitiBike stations locations is based on the 2018 Census Population by Zipcode data.
- The data gathered is only of the first 6 months of 2021, with the exception of January, in which the data was different with more personal details of each user.
- Since February 2021, the CitiBike company changed their data obtained from the users to be more private, for example taking out the gender and birthdate.

### Factors uncovered from the data:
1. Out of all the CitiBike users in Jersey City/Hoboken area, 58% are members with an annual membership. The rest are casual users per diem. Which can tell us that most of the users are locals that travel in bike because of traffic, pollution, saving money, parking and easy access to dense city areas.
2. 83% of the bikes rented are docked bikes (known as ebikes). One of the reasons that this factor is so significant, is because the docked bikes get a speed of up to 18 MPH without the user being pedaling.
3. The most used stations are close to the waterfront of Jersey City/Hoboken or near train stations. Which tells us again, that members and casuals are probably using the Citibikes to go to work downtown, go to the train to NYC, tour by the waterfront, etc.
