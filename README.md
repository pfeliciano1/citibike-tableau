# Tableau: CitiBike Analysis 2021

### The charts in this presentation show the general information of CitiBike trips in the Jersey City/Hoboken area from February 2021 through June 2021, indicating the ride types, options for member and casual riders, amount of trips per station, average miles per station and peak hours of usage.

### Some of the questions answered by this data analysis are:
1. What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?

2. What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?

3. Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)

4. What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?
